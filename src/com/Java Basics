Objects are real world entities. Real-World objects have two characteristics. State and behaviour. Dogs have state (name, colour, breed) and behaviour(barking, eating)

A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes. In this example, Bicycle now becomes the superclass of MountainBike, RoadBike, and TandemBike. In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.

 Nested classes are divided into two categories: non-static and static. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes. Nested classes that are declared static are called static nested classes.
